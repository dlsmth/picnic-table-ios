# Picnic Table iOS AR

We had just cleaned up the yard and cleared a space for a table and chairs. She just wanted something from Ikea. I wanted to build my own picnic table. It would cost more in materials, be more time-confusing, and may be a disaster in the end. I had also been interested in taking an AR app from sketch to ta-da! to gain more insight into the technology and the workflow. This was certainly a great opportunity to explore building an AR-focused iOS app.",

I sketched out the table, built it as a 3D model (in Blender), and then imported it into Xcode. Leveraging various elements of the ARKit library, I built one app to just display the model alone, and another app to show the model in its intended space, attached to the ground plane, at correct scale.

Current Status: While not rocket science, the app served its purpose. I was able to explor the workflow behind taking a 3D model into Xcode and incorporating it into an app, utlizing ARKit. Oh, and yes, I got buy-in from my primary stakeholder, and the table was approved. I built it out of Redwood (to age in parity with the nearby fence), and then built a birdhouse with the leftover wood.

Blender, Xcode, Swift, ARKit, Redwood
